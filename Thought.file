How do I get Images to upload to the adventure they need to be with after they get turned into base 64?
Make an SQL request that gets all the adventure pictures with the correct id and association.
Take all those picture strings and run them through a function to convert them back into png files.
add all of those picture strings onto a scope variable so I can show them.
